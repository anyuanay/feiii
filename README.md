### This is 2017 Challenge

#### Introduction
The Financial Entity Identification and Information Integration (FEIII) challenge series aims to provide interesting datasets to researchers at the intersection of finance and big data. These datasets have sufficient data for exploration, but are left noisy and incomplete as they are found "in the wild". 

In year one, it was an "identifier alignment" challenge: given four databases of financial entities from four different sources, participants needed to find the entities in common across the databases.

In year two, it is with the theme of identifying and understanding the relationships among financial entities and the roles that they play in financial contracts as represented in documents and databases. The year two dataset consists of 10-K and 10-Q filings, and the task is to identify sentences in the filings that provide evidence for a specific relationship between the filing financial entity and another mentioned financial entity.
